# Finally I filtered the detector after extracting keypoints and before matching. For the dense matchers I should filter all the feature maps in the forward pass.


# Approaches for Applying Specular Masks to Colon Images

## Problem:
Excessive light in colon images creates specular highlights that interfere with image matching.

---

## üìå **Proposed Approaches:**

### 1. **Filtering Keypoints Before Entering the Matcher**

#### **How It Works:**
- The `specular_mask.py` file provides functions (`filter_keypoints_by_mask` and `filter_result`) that filter out keypoints within specular mask areas before matching [oai_citation:0‚Ä°specular_mask.py](file-service://file-Uw7gujdi18mQ6kT8XxbE9T).
- This method is integrated into `process_image_pairs`, applying `filter_result` before visualization [oai_citation:1‚Ä°process_image_pairs.py](file-service://file-L7d1sRs6Q5AyFMLTJeQtNc).

#### ‚úÖ **Pros:**
- **Direct Control:** Explicitly removes specular keypoints, preventing interference.
- **Simplicity:** Keeps the matcher code unchanged.
- **Flexibility:** Easy to modify and experiment with different masking strategies.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Reduces processing time by avoiding unnecessary keypoints.

#### ‚ùå **Cons:**
- **Loss of Information:** May over-filter, potentially losing useful keypoints near specular regions.
- **Limited Adaptivity:** Matcher lacks awareness of masked areas, reducing context-adaptive matching.

### 2. **Applying Masks Within the Attention Mechanism of LightGlue**

#### **How It Works:**
- The `LightGlue` class in the `GIM_LG` model uses attention mechanisms for keypoint matching [oai_citation:2‚Ä°gim.py](file-service://file-H7MW7vizy5vNWom2QUsxxa).
- Specular masks could be integrated into the attention process, allowing the model to deprioritize or ignore specular regions dynamically.

#### ‚úÖ **Pros:**
- **Adaptive Matching:** Dynamically focuses on reliable areas, improving robustness.
- **Information Retention:** Maintains spatial context by weighting keypoints differently instead of outright removal.
- **Learning Potential:** Model could learn to handle specularities better over time with training.

#### ‚ùå **Cons:**
- **Complexity:** Requires architectural changes and potential model retraining.
- **Risk of Misalignment:** Improper integration might still allow noisy regions to influence matching.
- **Computational Overhead:** Increased processing time, especially if not optimized.

## üéØ **Recommendation:**

- **Short Term / Fast Integration:** Use **Approach 1** (*Filter Keypoints Before Matching*). This approach is already partially implemented and offers a quick win by avoiding specular keypoints.
- **Long Term / Research-Driven:** If feasible, explore **Approach 2** (*Integrate Masks in Attention Mechanism*), which could lead to improved performance in challenging scenarios with specular highlights.
